2024-2025 College Hoops Predictor
NCAA Division I Basketball Matchup Score Prediction System

Author: Adam Pinkos
Course: CS3620 — Advanced Database Systems
Date: Spring 2025

## Overview ##

College Hoops Predictor is a full-stack NCAA Division I basketball analytics system that allows users to:

Select any two D1 teams
Generate a predicted final score
Get a win probability
View an in-depth numeric breakdown of why the model produced that score
View an embedded stat glossary explaining every metric

This project integrates:
- A Tkinter GUI interface for matchup selection
- A custom Python prediction engine
- Fully structured SQL schema for teams, matchups, ratings, advanced stats, and model outputs

Three real NCAA datasets:
 - cbb25.csv (advanced efficiency metrics)
 - 2025_cbb_results.csv (game results + scores)
 - ncaa_wp_matrix_2025.csv (team-vs-team win probability matrix)

 The system simulates simplified versions of real basketball analytics models (KenPom-style efficiencies, tempo adjustments, power ratings, logistic win probabilities, etc.), while remaining interpretable for end users.

# How the Prediction Model Works

The core prediction logic lives in prediction.py.
The model computes a predicted margin (Team1 − Team2) using:

1. Offensive / Defensive Efficiency

From cbb25.csv:

ADJOE — Adjusted offensive efficiency

ADJDE — Adjusted defensive efficiency

2. Team Strength Metrics

BARTHAG — Power rating

rk / RK — Rank (lower = better)

Tempo (ADJ_T)

3. Rating Matrix Comparison

From ncaa_wp_matrix_2025.csv:

rating_team – rating_opponent

Reversed rows are handled automatically.

4. Home / Away Adjustment

H = +3.5

V = −3.5

N = 0

5. Total Points Prediction

Uses:

Team scoring averages

League average scoring

Pace (tempo) adjustment

Clamping to realistic D1 scores (120–180)

6. Score Solver

Using two equations:

team_score + opp_score = total
team_score - opp_score = margin


Produce final predicted scores, clamped to 40–115.

7. Win Probability

A logistic curve converts final margin → win chance.

GUI Features (gui.py)

The GUI is built using Tkinter and provides:

# Team Search

Searchable listboxes for Team 1 and Team 2.

# Score Prediction

Shows:

Final predicted score

Win probability

# Scrollable Breakdown Panel

Displays numeric explanations:

Offense/Defense differences

BARTHAG, ranking, rating diffs

Point contributions to the spread

Tempo-adjusted total scoring calculations

# Stat Glossary Tab

A second GUI tab explains every stat:

ADJOE / ADJDE

BARTHAG

Tempo (ADJ_T)

Rank interpretation

Rating matrix meaning

Margin components

Beginner-friendly explanations included.

 Datasets Used
1. cbb25.csv

From the original project, includes:

ADJOE

ADJDE

BARTHAG

ADJ_T

SEED

rk / RK

Team name

2. 2025_cbb_results.csv

Includes:

team

opponent

teamscore

oppscore

location (H/V/N)

total_points (generated)

margin (generated)

3. ncaa_wp_matrix_2025.csv

Contains predicted ratings for matchup pairs:

team

# SQL Database Schema

The SQL schema lives in /sql/ (recommendation):

Core Tables

seasons

teams

conferences

team_season_advanced_stats

game_results

rating_matrix

Prediction System Tables

model_versions

model_features

training_samples

precomputed_matchup_projections

prediction_feature_values

matchup_predictions

User & Favorite Tables

users

favorite_teams

audit_log

Analytics Tables

team_scoring_summaries

team_location_splits

matchup_history_summary

schedule_strength

team_recent_form

The schema is structured to support:

model training

model versioning

fast lookup projections

historical analysis

user-stored predictions

All tables include foreign keys and cascading behavior.

# How to Run the Predictor
1. Install dependencies
pip install pandas


Tkinter comes preinstalled on most Python distributions.

2. Place CSVs in project folder

Make sure the files are named exactly:

cbb25.csv

2025_cbb_results.csv

ncaa_wp_matrix_2025.csv

3. Run the GUI
python gui.py
